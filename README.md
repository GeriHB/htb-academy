# HackTheBox

In this directory there will be information and write-ups about different **Hack The Box Academy** modules.

There are paths and modules in different directories, and they all have the **Knowledge Base** and the write-ups for the labs.

In the Knowledge Base there will be the most important information for the module, which can serve as general knowledge, and specific information about the topics, but also the information needed to solve the labs.
