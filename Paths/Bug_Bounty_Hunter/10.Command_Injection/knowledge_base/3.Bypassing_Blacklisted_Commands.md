# Bypassing Blacklisted Commands

A command blacklist usually has a set of words.

If we can obfuscate them, we may be able to bypass these filters.

A common obfuscation technique is to insert certain characters that are ignored within the command.

Some of these characters are single-quote `'` and double-quote `"`.

For example to obfuscate the `whoami` command we can execute is as `w'h'o'am'i`.

The important part is that **the number of quotes must be even**.

**Linux Only**

`\` backslash is anotehr character, and also the positional parameter `$@`.

The number of characters don't have to be even.

**Windows only**

A caret character `^` is ignored on Windows.
