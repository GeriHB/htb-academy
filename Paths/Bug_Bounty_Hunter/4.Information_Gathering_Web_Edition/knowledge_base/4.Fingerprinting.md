# Fingerprinting

Extracting technical details about the technologies powering a website or a web app.

Techniques:
- Banner Grabbing - Analysing the banners presented by web servers and other services, which can reveal the server software, version numbers, etc.
- HTTP Headers - They contain a lot of information, `server` typically discloses the web server software, while `X-Powered-By` might reveal additional technologies like scripting languages or frameworks.
- Probing for Specific Responses - Sending requests specially crafted can provoke unique responses that reveal specific technologies or versions. For example error messages.
- Page Content - Structure, scripts, and other elements, can give clues about the underlying technologies.

Tools:
- Wappalyzer - Browser extension that identifies a wide range of web technologies.
- BuiltWith - Web technology profiler that provides detailed reports.
- WhatWeb - CLI tool that uses a database of signatures to identify technologies.
- Nmap - Network scanner that can be used with scripts to perform specialized fingerprinting.
- Netcraft - Detailed reports on technology, provider, and security posture.
- wafw00f - CLI to determine if a WAF is present, it's type and configuration.
