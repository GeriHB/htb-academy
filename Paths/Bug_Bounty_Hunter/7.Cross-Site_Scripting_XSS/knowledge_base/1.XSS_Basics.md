# XSS Basics

These vulnerabilities arise when the user input is not properly sanitized and allows to write JS code to the page and execute it on the client side.

A web app receives HTML code from the backend and renders it on the browser. 

When the app doesn't properly sanitize this input, the attacker can inject JS code in an input field.

XSS vulnerabilities are executed on the client-side and don't directly affect the backend, only the user executing the vulnerbility.
