## Challenge

Try running a VHost fuzzing scan on 'academy.htb', and see what other VHosts you get. What other VHosts did you get?

## Solution

First we need to add assign the ip to the academy.htb on our hosts:

```sh
sudo sh -c 'echo "94.237.48.253 academy.htb" >> /etc/hosts'
```

Then let's run the scan fo VHosts, by adding the `-H` option:

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ  -u http://academy.htb:50837 -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb'
```

Here I got a lot of results, and all of them had the `200 OK` as expected, but the common filesize is 986, so let's filter that with the option `-fs`.

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt:FUZZ  -u http://academy.htb:50837 -H 'Host: FUZZ.academy.htb' -fs 986
```

And I got two results:

```sh
test                    [Status: 200, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 34ms]
admin                   [Status: 200, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 1603ms]
```

And `test.academy.htb` is the answer to the lab.
