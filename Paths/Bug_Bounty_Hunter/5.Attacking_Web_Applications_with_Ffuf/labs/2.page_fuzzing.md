## Challenge

Try to use what you learned in this section to fuzz the '/blog' directory and find all pages. One of them should contain a flag. What is the flag?

## Solution

First let's check for the file extensions:

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt:FUZZ -u http://94.237.48.253:55426/indexFUZZ
```

The result is:

```sh

/'___\  /'___\           /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
\ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
\ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
\/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/

v2.1.0-dev

:: Method           : GET
:: URL              : http://94.237.48.253:55426/indexFUZZ
:: Wordlist         : FUZZ: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt
:: Follow redirects : false
:: Calibration      : false
:: Timeout          : 10
:: Threads          : 40
:: Matcher          : Response status: 200-299,301,302,307,401,403,405,500

.phps                   [Status: 403, Size: 281, Words: 20, Lines: 10, Duration: 341ms]
.php                    [Status: 200, Size: 986, Words: 423, Lines: 56, Duration: 4308ms]
:: Progress: [43/43] :: Job [1/1] :: 10 req/sec :: Duration: [0:00:04] :: Errors: 0 ::
```

So we got `200` status for `php`, and now let's search for pages with php extension:

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-1.0.txt:FUZZ -u http://94.237.48.253:55426/blog/FUZZ.php
```

with the result:

```sh
home                    [Status: 200, Size: 1046, Words: 438, Lines: 58, Duration: 33ms]
index                   [Status: 200, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 27ms]
```

Now, let's curl to the `home`:

```sh
curl 94.237.48.253:55426/blog/home.php
```

And in the returned html we see the flag:

```html
<h1>Admin panel moved to academy.htb</h1>
<br>
<p>HTB{bru73_f0r_c0mm0n_p455w0rd5}</p>
```
