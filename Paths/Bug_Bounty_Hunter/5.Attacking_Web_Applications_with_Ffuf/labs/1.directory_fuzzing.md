## Challenge
In addition to the directory we found above, there is another directory that can be found. What is it?

## Solution
First we need to install some wordlists. I get the `seclists`.

```sh
sudo apt install seclists
```

After that I run the command to fuzz the root directory:

```sh
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-1.0.txt:FUZZ -u http:94.237.48.253:55426/FUZZ
```

And the result is:

```sh
/'___\  /'___\           /'___\
/\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/
\ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\
\ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/
\ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\
\/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/
