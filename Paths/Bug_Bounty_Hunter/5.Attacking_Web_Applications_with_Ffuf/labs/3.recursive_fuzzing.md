## Challenge

Try to repeat what you learned so far to find more files/directories. One of them should give you a flag. What is the content of the flag?

## Solution

From the information I got from the two earlier labs, I know that it has files with .php extension.

So, I will use this to search recursively for directories and files.

```sh
ffuf -recursion -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-1.0.txt:FUZZ -u http://94.237.48.253:55426/FUZZ -e .php -v
```

From this, among the other results I got also a file:
```sh
[Status: 200, Size: 21, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 35ms]
| URL | http://94.237.48.253:55426/forum/flag.php
* FUZZ: flag.php
```
And after opening it, it gave me the flag.
