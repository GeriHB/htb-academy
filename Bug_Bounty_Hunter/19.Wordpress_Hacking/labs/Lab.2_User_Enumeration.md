## Challenge 1

From the last cURL command, what user name is assigned to User ID 2?

## Solution 1

As can be seen from the lab, the name assigned to the id=2 is `ch4p`.

```sh
curl http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users | jq

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "admin",
    "url": "",
    "description": "",
    "link": "http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/author/admin/",
    <SNIP>
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "ch4p",
    "url": "",
    "description": "",
    "link": "http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/author/ch4p/",
    <SNIP>
  },
<SNIP>
```
