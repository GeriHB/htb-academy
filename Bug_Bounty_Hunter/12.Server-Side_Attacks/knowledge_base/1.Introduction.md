# Introduction

Server-side attacks target the web server, such as the following vulnerabilities:
- SSRF - Server-side Request Forgery
- SSTI - Server-side Template Injection
- SSI - Server-side Includes Injection
- XSLT - eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations Server-side Injection.

**SSRF**
An attacker can manipulate a web app into sending unauthorized requests from the server. 

Often occurs when an app makes HTTP requests on other servers based on user input. 

Enables the attacker to access internal systems, bypass firewalls, and retrieve sensitive information.

**SSTI**
Web apps can utilize templating engines and server-side templates to generate responses such as HTML content dynamically.

Can lead to data leakage and RCE.

**SSI**
Generates HTML responses dynamically. Instruct the webserver to include additional content dynamically. For example it can be used to include content that is present in all HTML pages, such as headers or footers. 

Can lead to data leakage or even RCE.

**XSLT Server-Side Injection**
Arises when an attacker can manipulate XSLT transformations performet on the server.

XSTL is a language used to transform XML documetns into other formats, such as HTML, and is common to have on a web app.

So attackers exploit weknesses in how XSLT transformations are nandled, allowing the RCE.
