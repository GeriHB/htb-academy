# Certificate Transparency Logs

SSL/TLS protocol encrypts communication between the browser and the website.

At the heart of this protocol lies the **digital certificate**, which is a file that verifies the identity of a website.

Attackers can exploit the process of issuing and managing these certificates to impersonate websites, intercept sensitive data, or spread malware.

**What are these logs?**

These logs are public and whenever a CA issues a new certificate, it must submit to multiple CT logs, which are maintained by intependent organizations.

It's like a global registry of certificates.

Purpose of having them and the transparency:
- By monitoring them, researchers and website owners can quickly **identify suspicious or misussed certificates**. 
- These logs hold CAs accountable for their issuance practices, and if a certificate violates the rules or standards, it's publicly visible.
- The Web PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is a trust system underpinning secure communication, and the logs help to enhance the security and integrity by providing a mechanism for public oversight.

Searching these logs can be useful for attackers as it may even contain subdomains with old or expired certificates, which can host outdated software or configuration.

Tools to search the logs are `crt.sh, Censys`.

```sh
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u
```
