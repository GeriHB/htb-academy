# Back-End Vulenrabilities

## Common Web Vulnerabilities

### Broken Authentication/Access Control

**Broken Authentication** is when an attacker bypasses authentication functions, which may allow the attacker to login without credentials, or allow a normal user to become an administrator.

**Broken Access Control** allows an attacker to access pages and features that they shouldn't have access to, like the admin panel.

### Malicious File Upload

Is a vulnerbaility that allows uploading malicious script. This happens without properly validating the uploaded files, so the attacker can upload for example a php script.

## Command Injection
Many web apps allow executing local OS commands for example they may install a plugin by executing an OS command.

If not properly filtered, attackers may inject another command to be executed along the intended command to download the plugin.
