## Challenge
Try applying what you learned in this section by sending a 'POST' request to '/serial.php'. What is the response you get? 

## Solution
We send a request to the `/serial.php` path:

`curl -s 83.136.249.139:48238/serial.php -X POST`

And the result, which is also the flag is: `N2gxNV8xNV9hX3MzY3IzN19tMzU1NGcz`
