# ZAP Scanner

Can build site maps using ZAP Spider and perform both passive and active scans.

## Spider

Can be found on the *History* tab and `Attack -> Spider` from the right-click menu.

After clicking start, Spider looks for links and validates them.

## Passive Scanner

Spider runs and makes requests to various end-points, and during this time it runs the passive scanner on each response, and looks if it can identify any issues from the source code, like *missing security headers, DOM-based XSS vulnerbailities*.

## Active Scanner

When the tree is populated we can start an active scan on all the identified pages.

It tries various types of attacks and takes longer to complete.

When it is finished we can see the alerts.

Also then we can **generate a report** by selecting `Report -> Generate HTML report` from the top bar.
