# Web Fuzzer

To fuzz a website, we can use Burp Intruder.

First we see a reqeust that we made and right click to select send to intruder.

There we put positions marked with `ยง` which define in which place of the request we want to fuzz.

**Payloads**
Here we can choose or customize our paylaods/wordlists.

*Payloadd Sets* - This depends on the positions, so if we have just one position set then we have also one payload, and there we can also put what kind of payload we want, a `simple list` or which type is needed for our attack.

*Payload Options* - Is different for each payload type, and for example for a `simple list` we provide there a wordlist.

*Payload Processing* - allows to determine fuzzing rules, for example if we wanted to add an extension after our payload item.

*Options* - Customize the attack, we can set the number of `retried on failure`, `pause before retry` etc.

Here we have also the `grep - match` which helps to flag specific requests depending on the responses, for example if we want to fuzz for web directories, we will be interested only on `200 OK`.

`grep - extract` is useful if we are only interested on only a part of the response.
